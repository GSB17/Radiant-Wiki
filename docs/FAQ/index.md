# F.A.Q

## What is Radiant?

Radiant is peer-to-peer programmable digital asset system based off a fork of the genesis block of BCH. It adds new OPcodes that allow for turing completeness and mathematical induction proofs, which allow for solving the back to genesis problem. This makes Radiant a breakthrough design which provides the performance and parallelism benefits of an unspent transaction output (UTXO) blockchain, but with the contracting ability of account-based blockchains based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

* - POW, Smart Contract capable, fairly launched, big block Blockchain. 
 - Block 0 fork of BCH with added functionality.
 - Hashing algorithm is SHA512256d.
 - Difficulty algorithm is ASERT DAA.
 - Genesis Date: 20/06/2022 02:42:50 GMT+0000
 - Genesis Hash: 0000000065d8ed5d8be28d6876b3ffb660ac2a6c0ca59e437e1f7a6f4e003fb4
 - Block Time: 300 seconds / 5 minutes
 - Halving: 2 years (every 210,000 blocks)
 - Subsidy emission: 50000 per block
 - Total Coins: 21 Billion, with 8 decimal places for each*

## What makes Radiant stand out from other blockchain platforms?
-Induction Proofs that solve the back-to-genesis problem. No indexers ever required. 
-Account Emulation allows for EVM like applications.
-Turing complete scripting language: RadiantScript. 
-0conf feature allows for instant transactions.
-Split Node System allows for scalability

## How was Radiant fairly launched?
Radiant was bootstrapped as a ready-to-use, 100% PoW blockchain with no investors, no ICO, no premine, and no coin allocations. Before Radiant mining went online, guides on how to mine and even how to rent hash online to mine it without having GPUs were released publicly by Attoshi, Radiant's dev. Everyone was able to obtain RXD from day 1, ensuring a fair distribution.

## What is Radiant ethos? Is Radiant considered an investment? 
Radiant aims to be scalable and flexible blockchain technology. It wasn't designed to be invested in/to be expected to generate profits from buying RXD coins. Just like BTC was meant to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and not an investment vehicle, Radiant was designed as a peer-to-peer programmable digital asset system. It is not designed for investment purposes, and there's no promise of further development. But you can still "invest" (buy coins from an exchange) in it if you want. NFA. DYOR.

## Why is it a fork from BCH?
BTC civil wars divided blockchain enthusiasts into small block-ers and big block-ers. In BTC, small block-ers won and big block-ers forked it to crate BCH. BCH still deviated from what BTC was supposed to be based on what it is said on its' whitepaper. Another fork (BSV) was made, aiming to make it as close as possible to the original BTC proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. This version of Bitcoin still is far from perfect as it has to rely on third party indexers to function properly. On top of that, it is surrounded by drama and heavy baggage from certain person that affirms they are Satoshi, suing people left and right. That's why BCH was chosen as the building base for Radiant.

## What’s special about SHA512256d?
It is a hashing algorithm that takes a SHA512 hash and truncates it into SHA256. SHA512 is more secure than SHA256, but that's not the reason it was chosen. In reality SHA256 is already secure enough. But the implementation of such hashing algorithm allows for a secure, battle-tested Blockchain compatible with ASIC machines, without allowing the horde of existing SHA256 or SHA512 ASICs to take over control of Radiant. SHA512256d levels the playing field, allowing for a truly decentralized, massively scalable and extremely cost and power efficient Blockchain. At the moment no ASIC capable of mining RXD exists.

### When will ASICs for Radiant mining be available? 
Radiant was designed specifically to transition from GPU mining to ASIC mining to allow for a truly scalable and efficient system. The chosen algorithm allows for a straight-forward manufacturing process of ASICs. Still, there must exist solid economic incentive for manufacturers first. Developing ASIC machines is a costly task that involves millions of dollars and several months effort. It will only happen if Radiant is able to grow in community, price, and usage demand. 

## Why is the block time 5 minutes?
5 minute block time is a faster block speed than BTC while retaining stability and security (keeping orphan blocks at bay). With blocks of 256MB size and the possibility of even bigger blocks, it's essential to choose block time carefully. Block time in Radiant, thanks to it's features, isn't a direct limitation for transactions per second or transaction speed.

## What are the benefits of Radiant’s tokenomics?
With tokenization of digital and real word assets in mind, 21 billion coin supply future-proofs Radiant to be able to tokenize all of the worlds assets while leaving available RXD for micro and macro transactions. The 8 decimal places further address to this matter. The block time, block reward and biyearly halvings, are an incentive, attractive for miners and investors alike.

## What is the Back-To-Genesis problem?
In the context of blockchains, this problem refers to the ability to check that all coins,  transactions and digital assets are valid and can be traced back to the genesis block. To do this after years and billions of transactions without an external/third party indexer had never been possible before. Solving this problem allows Radiant to be a truly decentralized and permissionless digital asset system.

## What does Turing Complete mean and why have it?
Turing Completeness in the context of a programming language means there's no limit to what kind of computations can be done with it. This enables for extremely flexible smart contracting capabilities similar to those of ETH. With none of the scalability issues and insane gas costs of ETH, this feature makes Radiant unique. A one of a kind, paradigm shifting blockchain that truly enables all of the use cases of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Technically, Radiant can compute everything Ethereum can, while offering the performance and parallelism benefits of an UTXO blockchain.

### How is Radiant protected against attacks that harness turing completeness if it doesn't have a gas system like ETH?
Radiant is turing complete but it doesn't have loops. Loops have to be unrolled to the maximum number of iterations required. This is a lot simpler and safer, making script execution predictable so fees can be calculated per byte. This discourages malicious actors from creating overly complex or inefficient scripts, as they would have to pay more in fees. 

## What are 0conf transactions and are they safe?
A transaction that is broadcasted to the blockchain but still hasn't been included in a block (5 minutes haven't passed). This kind of transactions are very useful and safe to use for microtransactions. Thanks to induction proofs, when receiving a 0conf transaction you can be assured that the entity sending the funds indeed owns those funds. What you can't be assured of, is that this entity isn't trying to double-spend said funds. For small transactions, the potential reward for attempting a double-spend attack is typically much lower than the cost of acquiring mining hardware, electricity, and competing with the rest of the network's hash rate. In other words, it's not economically rational for an attacker to invest significant resources to double-spend a small transaction. For bigger transactions, waiting for them to be included in a block is best practice. Each additional block confirmation makes it exponentially more difficult to double-spend.

## How does the Split Node System work?
Being a big-blocked blockchain with scalability in mind, nodes in Radiant have the option of running 3 different ways: Mining Nodes which are light-weight, non resource-intensive, only dedicated to mining; Agent Nodes that contain only the useful information needed to feed to specific dApps/smart contracts, and Archival Nodes, which store the complete Blockchain. 

## Who created Radiant? 
Radiant was bootstrapped by a person/group of people by the pseudonym of "Attoshi". Just like Satoshi created BTC anonymously and let it  thrive on its own by its community, Attoshi delivered to the world a functional product, ready to use, without any promises or guarantees.
